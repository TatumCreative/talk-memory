# Memory Management in JavaScript

This is a talk I gave at the [200OK conference](http://200ok.us). It features
a graph visualization showing how memory is managed in JavaScript engines.

### Running the demo

Make sure npm is install, clone the repo, and then from the directory run
`npm install` to install the dependencies. The `index.html` file can be opened
directly, or run `npm run dev` to edit the source code. Run `npm run build` to
output a new `bundle.js`.
